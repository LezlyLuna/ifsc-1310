<h2>Art in Dance</h2>
<p>Imagine this, a group of dancers with beautifully colored dresses and very clean and neat suites. Both wearing heavy and clean shoes yet gliding ever so lightly. Men with emmbroiderd hates and suites swirlig aroud the beautiful girl fanning her skirt around in circles creating waves and patterns in mid air. </p>

<h3>It's Complexities</h3>
<p>This dance is called Baile Folklorico. It's style has many variations in its dance patterns, music, and spirit. This dance style hold so much of the Mexican history and makes it so beautiful. <em>Folkl√≥rico actually refers to many traditional dances from Mexico's different regions and states, rather than one single style, and you could fill multiple books with the details of every dance</em>, ast stated by <strong>DANCESPIRIT</strong></p>


<h4>Blending the Influences</h4>
<p> Gabriela Mendoza-Garcia, who is a dance scholar, choreographer, and an artistic directo in Texas says that this dance can go as back as the tim of the indigenous people living in Mexico. Then music and influence came when the Spanish Conquistadors came.</p>

<h5>Some History</h5>
<p> During the colonial period in 1525, immigrants from all over the world including Germany, France, parts of Asia and Africa, influenced with their music and dance styles as well. All of their traditions that they brought over started blending with the various Mexican regions and states.
<blockquote>"Every state has its unique dance that represents them"</blockquote>
states Raquel Ramirez, a teacher at Santa Monica College. Sometimes the dances will even include animals, a historic event, or just local lifestyles.</p>

<h6>Making a Dress</h6>
<p> Here's some extra information on how to actually make a dress and all thats included.Here are the materials needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1.5x7m or 3mx3m of cotton fabric(whatever color you want)</li>
  <li>1m reinforcement band for the belt</li>
  <li>Fringes(any color)</li>
  <li>Ribbons(any color)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li> First you make a pattern, really you just make two circles</li>
  <li> Next you make a slit in both sides of the skirt about 20cm</li>
  <li> Now we make the belt which has to be <strong>STRONG</strong> by cutting two long pieces of the same cotton fabric, 150x80cm and attatch the reinforcements in the middle. On one side, fold the fabric on top of the reinforcement, then fix the ends to make it look nice and attatch it to the skirt on the inside by sowing it.</li>
  <li> Now we make the fringes, this part is important. You'll need a lot of fabric and really you just attatch long strands of fabric all along the end by scrunching the top of the fringe part to the bottom of the skirt.</li>  
</ol>

<p>And with that you're done. Its a hard and complicated process but in the end, you'll have a wonderfull skirt. Here is some color and what they mean in Mexico, if you would like some inspiration.</p>
