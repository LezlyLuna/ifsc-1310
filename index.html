  <h1>Progressive enhancement</h1>
  <p> First off I'll say this. I love M&M's, so the article made me hungry. But anyways, this article was cool. It talked about the things we've been doing. 
  The layers it takes to make a website is simple, until you really get into it. It's a way to make things simple, elegent, and usable. As well as changeable. If it looks 
  all jambled up behind the scenes, it'll be absolutley horrifing to try and change or fix. And if the back is bad so will the candy coating in the front. 
  Java, CSS, images, it makes the content shine. Then theres time. Things change all the time. Browsers, rules, everything upgrades. With all this, we should be able to keep up if we do
  everything nicley. It'll all keep up.
  </p>
  <h1>Revisions</h1>
  <p> After seeing my project, my sisters laughed at my pain, it was funny to them just how bad I'd done. So I made a bit of a cleaner version for them. My middle sister said it's still pathetic
  but thats just her being jealous. She liked the grey tones I had chosen. I mainly just wanted to do that for them really. Although I can definetley see how getting
  feedback is VERY important. They were poinitng out how they really like my button transitions and they thought it was really cool!
  They also said that some colors were weird in someplace were I had light color on top of light color which made it hard to read.
  All in all it was a great experiance having them look at my work (unfinished).
